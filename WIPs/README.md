# WIPs
WebDollar Improvement Proposals (WIPs) describe standards for the WebDollar platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and other standards.

# Contributing

 1. Review [WIP-1](WIPs/wip-1.md).
 2. Fork the repository by clicking "Fork" in the top right.
 3. Add your WIP to your fork of the repository. There is a [template WIP here](wip-X.md).
 4. Submit a Pull Request to WebDollar's [repository](https://github.com/WebDollar/Node-WebDollar).

Your first PR should be a first draft of the final WIP. It must meet the formatting criteria enforced by the build (largely, correct metadata in the header). An editor will manually review the first PR for a new WIP and assign it a number before merging it. Make sure you include a `discussions-to` header with the URL to a discussion forum or open GitHub issue where people can discuss the WIP as a whole.

When you believe your WIP is mature and ready to progress past the draft phase, you should open a PR changing the state of your WIP to 'Final'. An editor will review your draft and ask if anyone objects to its being finalised. If the editor decides there is no rough consensus - for instance, because contributors point out significant issues with the WIP - they may close the PR and request that you fix the issues in the draft before trying again.
