### Abstract

This WIP defines new API endpoints for interacting with a WebDollar node.

### Specification

Example of JSON RPC for WebDollar

It will require: 

1. Check the balance of address
2. Check the Transactions of an address
3. Check a specific Transaction

Everything will return how many confirmations had those.

### Motivation

TBA.

### Rationale

TBA.

### Backwards Compatibility

The endpoints should all be new, so there are no backwards compatibility issues.

### Implementation

TBA.
